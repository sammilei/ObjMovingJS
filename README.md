# ObjMovingJS
Requirements Display an image of a robot near the left side of a web page. The image can be any graphics file you find on the web or create yourself. May I suggest one of the cool Android mascots from the last Google I/O conference. Display a Start button on the page. When the Start button is clicked: the robot shall start moving to the right. the Start button shall become a Stop button. When the Stop button is clicked: the robot shall stop moving. the Stop button shall become a Start button. The Start/Stop button shall work repeatedly. After the robot exits on the right, it shall re-enter from the left.  Hint: Use the window.innerWidth property.
